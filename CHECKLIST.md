# Checklist for creating a new repo

The following are some helpful steps and ideas to consider when you are creating a new repository from this template. Some of the ideas may be good ideas for repos generally.

We will eventually break this checklist into meaningful sections.

- [ ] Provide a concise and accurate description of your project in the GitHub "Description" field.
- [ ] Provide a meaningful URL in the GitHub "Website" field. For .NET Core projects, this should be "https://github.com/dotnet/core".
- [ ] Update all of the README.md files to be specific to your project, taking care to replace all of the "New Repo" strings.
- [ ] The contributing link in CONTRIBUTING.md is a good choice for .NET Core projects. Update as appropriate.
- [ ] Add THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES entries, as appropriate. Example of format: https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.
- [ ] Delete CHECKLIST.md
